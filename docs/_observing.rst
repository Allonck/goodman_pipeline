Observing Guidelines
********************

In order to be able to process your data with the |pipeline full name| you need
to follow some guidelines, we do not intend to tell you how to do your science
here are some basic hints.

- Make sure you have a good observing plan as well as a backup plan
- Put special attention to the calibration files that are needed for the data
  that you are planning to obtain, for instance, Imaging requires bias while for
  Spectroscopy is also recomended is not a strong requirements because there is
  the alternative of overscan.
- Keep a detailed log of things that happened while you were observing,
  mistakes that you made, exposures repeated, etc. An observing log is not an
  extraction of header information. Well, it can be but it will be useless.
- If you are unsure about the required steps to achieve your science goals ask
  your PI not the support scientist, Her/His job is to assist you on how to get
  good quality data not what data you need to achieve your goals.
