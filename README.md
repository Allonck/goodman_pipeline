# Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph Data Reduction Pipeline

The Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph (Goodman HTS) Data-Reduction Pipeline
is the SOAR Telescope's official data reduction pipeline for _Goodman HTS_.

It has been fully developed in Python 2.7 and mostly astropy affiliated packages
with the exception of [dcr](http://users.camk.edu.pl/pych/DCR/) an external tool
that does cosmic ray identification and correction. The reason for using it
instead of LACosmic was that it works very well for spectroscopic data and the
results are evidently superior. Some of the negative aspects of using this
external (meaning outside of Python domains) software were: The integration into
the pipeline's workflow and the use of an external `dcr.par` parameter file.
 Such parameters have to be changed by hand and can't be integrated into the
 pipeline's workflow itself. In particular for binning 2x2 and custom ROI those
 parameters contained in _dcr.par_ has to be specifically tuned.


The pipeline is currently in its first beta release version. We have thoroughly
tested it but we know there are still bugs to be found. If you found one or have
any comment please contact Sim√≥n Torres at storres [at] ctio noao edu.


The Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph is an imaging spectrograph, if you wish
to know more about the instrument please check the 
[SOAR website](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/soar/content/goodman-high-throughput-spectrograph)
 
To see full documentation please go to the GitHub hosted site for
[Goodman](https://soar-telescope.github.io/goodman/)

## What is contained in the project?

The Goodman HTS Pipeline has two packages, _goodman_ccd_ dedicated to the basic
ccd reduction process and _goodman_spec_ for advanced processing for 
spectroscopic data such as target identification and extraction for instance.

They are supposed to work in sequence and they are called from two indepentent 
scripts, _redccd_ and _redspec_. 

Other files included are:
- Readme.md (this)
- requirements.txt
- user_manual.pdf
- dcr binaries
- Library of Wavelength Calibrated lamps.

## How to install it?

The installation instructions are also detailed in the pdf manual
(user_manual.pdf).

### Specific platform instructions
_for installing on Ubuntu 16.04 see 
[this wiki](https://github.com/simontorres/goodman/wiki/Ubuntu-16.04-Installation-Experience)_

_for installing on Centos 7 see 
[this wiki](https://github.com/simontorres/goodman/wiki/Centos-7-Installation)_

Below you will find the instrucctions anyways, please refer to the wiki for the
specifics.

### Get the code
In case you want to get the full project you need to install `git`, if you 
don't, please go to [Get latest release](#get-latest-release). 
#### Install Git
This step will depend on your platform, below are two examples:

```shell
# Centos
sudo yum install git

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install git
```
#### Clone from GitHub
To clone from GitHub copy and paste the following line in a terminal.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/soar-telescope/goodman.git
```
 
You are not ready to install the pipeline yet.


### Get Latest Release 

Visit [this link](https://github.com/soar-telescope/goodman/tree/master/dist)
and download the newest file in the list.

#### Requirements

This software was developed on Python 2.7, use the included `requirements.txt`
file to install all the dependencies.

```shell
sudo -H pip2.7 install -r requirements.txt
```

Remember that if you do not have super user privileges, you can still install
all the requirements by adding the `--users` flag. There is also an option of
[installing it using different virtual environments](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) 
or even using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).


You may have some issues when using MatPlotLib on `virtualenvs` and on Mac OSX.
If so, you can try to follow the instructions on
[this site](http://matplotlib.org/faq/osx_framework.html#osxframework-faq) and,
then add the following line on your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file.

```shell
alias python='pythonw' 
```

### Install DCR (Cosmic Ray Rejection)
This pipeline uses [DCR](http://users.camk.edu.pl/pych/DCR/) developed by 
[Wojtek Pych](mailto:pych@camk.edu.pl) instead of `ccdproc.cosmicray_lacosmic` 
because we got better results with `DCR`. Unfortunately you will have to compile
it, I have successfully compiled it on Centos 7, Ubuntu 16.04, Linux Mint 18.1, 
Solaris 11 and MacOS Sierra. The pre-compiled versions are distributed with
the package but it is not guaranteed they will work on your running platform.


Follow [this link](http://users.camk.edu.pl/pych/DCR/) where you can find the 
instructions in order to get and compile the `dcr` code. 
The same instructions are reproduced here.

Download the `dcr.tar` file and untar it.
```shell
tar -xvf dcr.tar
```

Compile it
```shell
make
```

If you don't get any errors you can try it without any arguments and you will
get something like this
```shell
$ ./dcr

        USAGE:  dcr  input_file  cleaned_file  cosmicrays_file

File 'dcr.par' must be present in the working directory.
      ~~~~~~
```

#### Make it available for the system
Now that you have compiled the program you have a file called `dcr` you need to
put it in the `$PATH` variable of your system. I usually use `bash` so if you
use something different follow the example below as a guide.

 1. Create a directory to place the executable
     ```shell
     $ mkdir ~/.bin
     ```
     Note that in the example above the directory .bin will be hidden and the 
     symbol `~` denotes your home directory for instance: `/home/goodman/`
 2. Move `dcr` to your new folder.
     ```shell
     $ mv dcr ~/.bin
     ```
 3. Add the directory to the `PATH` variable. With your favorite text editor, 
 open the file `~/.bashrc`
     ```shell
     $ vim ~/.bashrc
     ```
     At the end add the following line.
     ```text
     export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/.bin
     ```
     If you don't know your home directory do the following
     ```shell
     $ cd
     $ pwd
     ```
     Replace `/home/user/`for whatever the output is in the last command
 
 4. Reload the environment variables. For this you can simply close and reopen
 the terminal or you can do:
     ```shell
     $ source ~/.bashrc
     ```

## How to use it?
 
The pipeline is run by two separated scripts. _redccd_ and _redspec_. 
The `--help` argument will print the argument plus some short description.
Also check the manual included in the distribution package.


# Acknowledge

[David Sanmartim](https://github.com/dsanmartim) developed the first version of
the ccd reduction part before he moved to a new position. That first version was
included in the pipeline as a package and has evolved along all the code.
