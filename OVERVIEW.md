# Pipeline Overview

## What is it?

This is a set of tools for data reduction of the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph's data. 
This instrument is currently in operation at Soar Telescope in northern Chile. 

Although we try to make the pipeline as _flexible_ as possible but at the same time it has a high level of
automatization is important that you follow our _Observing Guidelines_ while obtaining the data.
Those guidelines were thought from an experienced point of view, in other words it considers what
works best for most scientific programs. For instance, if you are doing radial velocity studies
you will need to have, ideally, the science target _"bracketed"_ by comparison lamps or if you don't
care much about radial velocity precision you would apply one single wavelength solution to all the
data obtained throughout the night.
 
## Exactly, how it works?
